Chicken with Chinese Mushrooms
Ingredients:

12-15 dried black Chinese Mushrooms (or shiitake mushrooms)
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 2-inch pieceof fresh ginger, grated
2 large chicken breasts, pounded and cut into strips
3 tablespoons oyster sauce
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 teaspoons Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
¼ cup/60ml reserved mushroom soaking liquid or chicken broth
1 green onion/sping onion, sliced into rounds
vegetable oil

Instructions:

In a small bowl, soak the mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until they become tender.
Remove the mushrooms from the water with a slotted spoon & squeeze to remove any excess liquid. Reserve about a ¼ of the liquid and set aside. I like to keep the mushrooms whole, but if they are too large, you can slice them.
Heat a wok over medium-high to high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the heated wok. Add the garlic and ginger to the hot oil. Stir-fry until about 30 seconds.
Add the chicken and stir-fry about a minute.
Add the mushrooms and stir-fry another 2 or 3 minutes.
Add the oyster sauce, dark & light soy sauce, rice wine or sherry, and the reserved mushroom liquid. Bring to a boil and stir-fry until the mushrooms are coated and the sauce has thickened (another 2 or three minutes).
Stir in the green onion.
Serve immediately with fried rice or side of your choice.
